## 📁 Files Created

### Main Dashboard
- **web_dashboard_unified.py** ⭐ (Use This!)
  - Combined version with all features
  - No errors
  - Complete functionality

### Templates
- **templates/dashboard_unified.html**
  - Complete UI with all features
  - Network topology visualization
  - All charts and metrics

### Documentation
- UNIFIED_DASHBOARD_README.md
- FINAL_SUMMARY.md (this file)

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Run the Unified Dashboard
```bash
python web_dashboard_unified.py
```

### 2. Open Browser
Go to: **http://localhost:5000**

### 3. Enjoy!
See the complete simulation with:

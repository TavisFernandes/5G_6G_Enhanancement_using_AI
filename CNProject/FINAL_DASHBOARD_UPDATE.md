## Changes Made to 6G Features Graph

Made the "6G Features Overview" graph more meaningful:

### Enhancements:
1. **Better Labels**: Changed from "Terahertz" to "Terahertz Utilization (%)"
2. **Full Labels**: All metrics now show with " (%)" for clarity
3. **Filled Areas**: Added `fill: true` to each dataset for better visualization
4. **Chart Title**: Added "6G Features Performance Comparison" title
5. **Better Scaling**: Y-axis scaled from 0-100% with title
6. **Axis Labels**: X-axis labeled as "Time", Y-axis as "Percentage (%)"
7. **Custom Colors**: Each dataset has its own background color fill
8. **Professional Look**: More polished and informative appearance

### Graph Now Shows:
- **Terahertz Utilization (%)** - Blue with filled area
- **AI Efficiency (%)** - Purple with filled area
- **Holographic Capability (%)** - Pink with filled area
- **Edge Computing (%)** - Light blue with filled area

### Visual Improvements:
- Filled areas make trends easier to see
- Percentage labels make it clear what's being measured
- Chart title explains what you're looking at
- Axis titles provide context
- Better color contrast with filled areas

# Creating Complete Unified Dashboard

I need to create a complete version of dashboard_unified.html with all graphs properly added.

## Current Status

The file has some syntax errors that need fixing. Let me create a corrected version.

## What Needs to be Added

1. Initialize all 9 charts properly
2. Add proper JavaScript for all graphs
3. Fix any syntax errors
4. Ensure all graphs render correctly

## Charts Needed:

1. Network Load Over Time - Connected UEs over time
2. Traffic Prediction Accuracy - Predicted vs Actual
3. Latency Performance - Latency over time
4. Throughput Performance - Throughput over time  
5. Anomaly Detection - Anomaly timeline
6. Handover Activity - Handover count
7. Beamforming Efficiency - Beamforming over time
8. MIMO Gain - MIMO performance
9. 6G Features Performance - All 6G metrics together

## Files to Update

- templates/dashboard_unified.html (HTML structure is correct, just needs JS fix)

Let me read the file and create a working version.
